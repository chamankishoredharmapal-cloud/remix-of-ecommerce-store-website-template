              <p>
                By using the House of Padmavati website you accept the gentle terms below. They are kept
                short because we believe in fewer words.
              </p>

              <h2 className="font-serif text-2xl text-ink mb-3">Sarees, orders & care</h2>
              <p>
                Each saree is hand-woven and one of one. We work to describe colour and weave honestly, but
                screens vary; the cloth in your hands may be very slightly different from the cloth on screen,
                and that variance is part of the work.

              <p>
                Returns are accepted within 14 days of delivery for sarees in unworn condition. Custom blouses,
                bridal pieces, and engraved keepsake cards are final sale.
